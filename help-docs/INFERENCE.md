Mettalog is an advanced inference engine inspired by EProver. In addition to logical reasoning, we've extended Mettalog to emulate running code, allowing for a powerful combination of logical inference and procedural execution.

## Features

- **Logical Inference:** Solve complex logical problems and theorems.
- **Code Emulation:** Execute or simulate programming code seamlessly integrated with logical inference.
- **Knowledge Representation:**
  - **MeTTa KR:** Custom Knowledge Representation for logical rules and axioms.
  - **SUMO:** Suggested Upper Merged Ontology for sophisticated ontological representation.

## Axioms and Logical Rules

Here's an example of an axiom in both MeTTa KR and SUMO KR:

### MeTTa KR

In Mettalog's native format:

```lisp
(= (next-number $x) (+ 1 $x))
```

## Examples

### Logical Inference

Given a set of axioms and rules, Mettalog can infer new facts. For example:

#### MeTTa KR

Axioms:
```lisp
(= (next-number $x) (+ 1 $x))
(= (even $x) (if (= (mod $x 2) 0) true false))
```

Query:
```lisp
(next-number 5)
```

Mettalog's inference:
```lisp
6
```

#### SUMO KR

Axioms:
```lisp
(equals (next-number ?x) (AdditionFn ?x 1))
(equals (even ?x) (case (equal (RemainderFn ?x 2) 0) true false))
```

Query:
```lisp
(next-number 5)
```

Mettalog's inference:
```lisp
6
```

### Code Emulation

Mettalog can emulate running code to solve problems that require procedural steps. Hereâ€™s an example in Python:

```python
def next_number(x):
    return x + 1

def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0

next_number(5)  # Output: 6
is_even(5)  # Output: False
```

Emulated in Mettalog:

```lisp
(defun next-number (x) (+ x 1))
(defun is-even (x) (== (mod x 2) 0))

(next-number 5)  ; Output: 6
(is-even 5)      ; Output: false
```

### Combined Inference and Emulation

Mettalog can combine logical inference and code emulation for more complex scenarios. For example, finding the next even number after a given number:

#### Logical Inference

Axioms:
```lisp
(= (next-number $x) (+ 1 $x))
(= (even $x) (if (= (mod $x 2) 0) true false))
```

Procedure:
```lisp
(defun next-even-number (x)
  (if (even (next-number x))
    (next-number x)
    (next-number (next-number x))))
```

Query:
```lisp
(next-even-number 5)
```

Mettalog's result:
```lisp
6
```

#### Code Emulation

Python code:
```python
def next_number(x):
    return x + 1

def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0

def next_even_number(x):
    next_num = next_number(x)
    if is_even(next_num):
        return next_num
    else:
        return next_number(next_num)

next_even_number(5)  # Output: 6
```

Emulated in Mettalog:
```lisp
(defun next-number (x) (+ x 1))
(defun is-even (x) (== (mod x 2) 0))

(defun next-even-number (x)
  (if (is-even (next-number x))
    (next-number x)
    (next-number (next-number x))))

(next-even-number 5)  ; Output: 6
```

## Conclusion

Mettalog bridges the gap between logical reasoning and code execution, providing a powerful tool for complex problem-solving. Whether you're working with logical theorems or procedural code, Mettalog offers a seamless integration of both worlds.

## Installation

To install Mettalog, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/trueagi-io/metta-wam.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd mettalog`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the tests to ensure everything is set up correctly: `pytest`

## Usage

To use Mettalog, import the main module and start defining your axioms and rules:

```python
from mettalog import Engine

engine = Engine()

# Define your axioms and rules here
engine.add_axiom('(= (next-number $x) (+ 1 $x))')
engine.add_axiom('(= (even $x) (if (= (mod $x 2) 0) true false))')

# Query the engine
result = engine.query('(next-number 5)')
print(result)  # Output: 6
```
