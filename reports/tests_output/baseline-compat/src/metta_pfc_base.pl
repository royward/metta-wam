 * Project: MeTTaLog - A MeTTa to Prolog Transpiler/Interpreter
 * Description: This file is part of the source code for a transpiler designed to convert
 *              MeTTa language programs into Prolog, utilizing the SWI-Prolog compiler for
 *              optimizing and transforming function/logic programs. It handles different
 *              logical constructs and performs conversions between functions and predicates.

%
%   This predicate ensures that only one version of a term with the same structure
%   is present at a time, retracting any matching terms before the new assertion.

%
%   @arg GeneralTerm The term to be checked for existence.
%   @arg Default     The term to be asserted if `GeneralTerm` is absent.
%
%   @example
%     % Ensure a default mode is set if none exists.
%     ?- pfcDefault(fcTmsMode(_), fcTmsMode(cycles)).

%
%   Controls the Truth Maintenance System (TMS) algorithm by setting its mode.
%   The mode can be one of the following:
%     - `none`: Disables the TMS algorithm.
%     - `local`: Uses a local version of the TMS.
%     - `cycles`: Uses a cycle-based TMS algorithm.
%
%   @example

%   Specifies the search strategy used by the PFC (Prolog Forward Chaining)
%   system. The strategy can be one of:
%     - `direct`: Executes search directly without expanding paths.
%     - `depth`: Uses depth-first search.
%     - `breadth`: Uses breadth-first search.
%
%   @example
%     % Set the default search strategy to 'direct' if not defined.

%!  pfcAdd(+P) is det.
%
%   Adds a new clause or fact `P` to the database. This version retrieves the

%   Adds a clause or fact `P` to the database with the given support `S`.

%   forward reasoning is initiated.
%
%   @arg P  The clause or fact to be added.
%   @arg S  The support context or reason for adding the clause.
%
%   @example

%   Adds support for the given fact and handles uniqueness checks before posting

%!  pfcdo(+Goal) is det.
%
%   Executes a goal once and always succeeds, even if the goal fails.
%
%   @arg Goal  The goal to execute.

%   @example

%!  pfcUnion(+List1, +List2, -Union) is det.
%
%   Computes the union of two sets represented as lists. Duplicates are removed
%   by checking membership before adding elements.
%
%   @arg List1  The first input list.
%   @arg List2  The second input list.
%   @arg Union  The resulting union of the two input lists.
%
%   @example
%     ?- pfcUnion([a, b], [b, c], Union).
%     Union = [a, b, c].
%
pfcUnion([], L, L).

%!  pfcConjoin(+Conjunct1, +Conjunct2, -Conjunction) is det.
%
%   Simplifies the conjunction of two expressions. If either conjunct
%   is `true`, the result is the other conjunct. Otherwise, the result
%   is the conjunction of both expressions.
%
%   @arg Conjunct1    The first expression to conjoin.
%   @arg Conjunct2    The second expression to conjoin.
%   @arg Conjunction  The resulting simplified conjunction of the two expressions.
%
%   @example
%     % Simplify conjunction with true:
%     ?- pfcConjoin(true, X > 0, Result).
%     Result = (X > 0).
%
%     % Conjoin two non-trivial expressions:

%   Purpose: predicates to manipulate a pfc database (e.g. save,
% %     restore, reset, etc.0

%!  pfcDatabaseTerm(+PA) is nondet.
%
%   True if `PA` is a term that PFC adds to the database and should not
%   be present in an empty PFC database. This predicate identifies terms
%   that are specific to the PFC system, such as rules, triggers, and queues.
%
%   @arg P/A  A functor/arity pair representing a term in the PFC database.
%
%   @example
%     ?- pfcDatabaseTerm('$pt$'/2).
%     true.
%
pfcDatabaseTerm('$spft$'/3).
pfcDatabaseTerm('$pt$'/2).
pfcDatabaseTerm('$bt$'/2).
pfcDatabaseTerm('$nt$'/3).
pfcDatabaseTerm('==>'/2).
pfcDatabaseTerm('<==>'/2).
pfcDatabaseTerm('<-'/2).
pfcDatabaseTerm(pfcQueue/1).

%!  pfcReset is det.
%
%   Removes all forward chaining rules and justifications from the database.
%   If the database is not empty after attempting to reset, an error is raised.
%
%   @example
%     ?- pfcReset.
%
pfcReset :-
    % Iterate over all PFC facts and justifications to remove them.
    pfc_spft(P, F, Trigger),
    pfcRetractOrWarn(P),
    pfcRetractOrWarn('$spft$'(P, F, Trigger)),
    fail.
pfcReset :-
    % If the database is not empty, raise an error.
    (pfcDatabaseItem(T) *->
        (pfcError("Pfc database not empty after pfcReset, e.g., ~p.~n", [T]), fail)
    ;
        true).

%!  pfcDatabaseItem(:TermBody) is nondet.
%
%   True if the given `Term :- Body` is a "PFC-specific" item in the database.
%   These items correspond to terms that PFC adds, which should not be present
%   in an empty database.
%
%   @arg Term  The term representing a PFC database entry.
%   @arg Body  The body of the clause associated with the term.
%
%   @example
%     ?- pfcDatabaseItem(Term :- Body).
%
pfcDatabaseItem(Term :- Body) :-
    % Check if the term matches a known PFC database term.
    pfcDatabaseTerm(P/A),
    functor(Term, P, A),
    % Ensure the clause exists in the database.
    clause(Term, Body).

%!  pfcRetractOrWarn(+X) is det.
%
%   Retracts the given clause or fact `X` from the database. If the retraction
%   fails, a warning message is generated.
%
%   @arg X  The clause or fact to retract.
%
%   @example
%     ?- pfcRetractOrWarn(foo).
%
pfcRetractOrWarn(X) :-
    % Attempt to retract the clause or fact.
    retract(X),
    !.
pfcRetractOrWarn(X) :-
    % If retraction fails, issue a warning.
    pfcWarn("Couldn't retract ~p.", [X]),
    nop((dumpST, pfcWarn("Couldn't retract ~p.", [X]))),
    !.

%!  pfcRetractOrQuietlyFail(+X) is nondet.
%
%   Attempts to retract the given clause or fact `X`. If retraction fails,
%   the operation quietly fails without raising an error or warning.
%
%   @arg X  The clause or fact to retract.
%
%   @example
%     ?- pfcRetractOrQuietlyFail(foo).
%
pfcRetractOrQuietlyFail(X) :-
    % Attempt to retract the clause or fact.
    retract(X),
    !.
pfcRetractOrQuietlyFail(X) :-
    % If retraction fails, log a trace message and quietly fail.
    nop((pfcTraceMsg("Trace: Couldn't retract ~p.", [X]),
        nop((dumpST, pfcWarn("Couldn't retract ~p.", [X]))))),
    !,
    fail.
