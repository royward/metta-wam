% %
% %
% %  predicates for manipulating support relationships
% %

%!  pfcAddSupport(+P, +Support) is det.
%
%   Adds support for a given proposition by asserting the support fact.
%
%   This predicate is used to record the support for a proposition 'P'. It takes 
%   a pair consisting of a 'Fact' and a 'Trigger', and asserts that this support 
%   exists by storing it in the form of a special fact.
%
%   @arg P       The proposition being supported.
%   @arg Support A pair '(Fact, Trigger)' representing the support for 'P'. The 
%                'Fact' is the actual support fact, and the 'Trigger' is the condition 
%                or event that supports the proposition.
%
%   @example
%     % Add support for a fact 'some_fact' with the trigger 'some_trigger'.
%     ?- pfcAddSupport(some_fact, (some_support, some_trigger)).
%     
%     % This will assert that the fact 'some_fact' is supported by 'some_support' and 
%     % 'some_trigger'.
%
pfcAddSupport(P, (Fact, Trigger)) :- 
    % Assert the support fact using the '$spft$' predicate.
    assert('$spft$'(P, Fact, Trigger)).

%!  pfcGetSupport(+P, -Support) is semidet.
%
%   Retrieves the support information for a given proof P.
%   The support is provided in the form of a tuple '(Fact, Trigger)', 
%   where 'Fact' is a fact involved in the proof, and 'Trigger' is 
%   an event or condition that triggered the proof.
%
%   @arg P       The proof for which the support information is being retrieved.
%   @arg Support A tuple '(Fact, Trigger)' where 'Fact' is a fact and 'Trigger'
%                is the corresponding trigger event or condition.
%
%   @example
%     % Retrieve support information for a given proof:
%     ?- pfcGetSupport(P, Support).
%     Support = (Fact, Trigger).
%
pfcGetSupport(P, (Fact, Trigger)) :-
    % Retrieves the support using pfc_spft/3, which extracts the Fact and Trigger
    % for the given proof P.
    pfc_spft(P, Fact, Trigger).

%!  pfc_spft(+P, -Fact, -Trigger) is semidet.
%
%   Retrieves the fact and trigger that support the given proof P.
%   This predicate internally calls the system predicate '$spft$' to get the 
%   fact ('F') and trigger ('T') associated with the proof.
%
%   @arg P    The proof for which the fact and trigger are being retrieved.
%   @arg Fact The fact involved in the proof.
%   @arg Trigger The trigger event or condition related to the proof.
%
%   @example
%     % Retrieve the fact and trigger for a proof P:
%     ?- pfc_spft(P, Fact, Trigger).
%     Fact = some_fact,
%     Trigger = some_trigger.
%
pfc_spft(P, F, T) :-
    % Calls the system predicate '$spft$'/3 to retrieve the fact (F) and trigger (T)
    % for the given proof P.
    pfcCallSystem('$spft$'(P, F, T)).

% There are three of these to try to efficiently handle the cases
% where some of the arguments are not bound but at least one is.

%!  pfcRemOneSupport(+P, +FactTriggerPair) is semidet.
%
%   Removes one support relationship between a fact and a trigger.
%   This predicate ensures that at least one of P, Fact, or Trigger is callable,
%   and then attempts to retract the support fact associated with them.
%
%   The support fact being retracted is represented as '$spft$'(P, Fact, Trigger).
%
%   @arg P The primary predicate or fact that is being checked for support.
%   @arg FactTriggerPair A tuple (Fact, Trigger) representing the fact and the trigger
%                        that together form the support relationship for P.
%
%   @example
%     % Suppose P is some predicate, Fact is a fact, and Trigger is a condition
%     % that supports the fact P. The following retracts this support relationship:
%     ?- pfcRemOneSupport(P, (Fact, Trigger)).
%
pfcRemOneSupport(P, (Fact, Trigger)) :-
    % Ensure that at least one of P, Fact, or Trigger is callable.
    must_ex(callable(P); callable(Fact); callable(Trigger)),
    % Attempt to retract the support fact '$spft$'(P, Fact, Trigger).
    pfcRetractOrWarn('$spft$'(P, Fact, Trigger)).

%!  pfcRemOneSupportOrQuietlyFail(+P, +Support) is det.
%
%   Removes one support fact or fails quietly if the support fact cannot be retracted.
%   This predicate ensures that the arguments are callable and attempts to retract 
%   the support fact represented as '$spft$'(P, Fact, Trigger). It will silently fail 
%   if the retract operation does not succeed, ensuring that no exceptions are thrown.
%
%   @arg P       The primary fact or rule that was supported.
%   @arg Support A tuple of the form (Fact, Trigger) representing the fact and trigger 
%                that provided support for the primary fact P.
%
%   @example Remove a specific support for a fact:
%     ?- pfcRemOneSupportOrQuietlyFail(rule1, (fact1, trigger1)).
%
pfcRemOneSupportOrQuietlyFail(P, (Fact, Trigger)) :-
    % Ensure that P, Fact, or Trigger are callable terms.
    must_ex(callable(P); callable(Fact); callable(Trigger)),
    % Attempt to retract the support fact represented as '$spft$'(P, Fact, Trigger).
    pfcRetractOrQuietlyFail('$spft$'(P, Fact, Trigger)).

%!  pfc_collect_supports(-Triples) is det.
%
%   Collects all triples that are supported by the PFC (Prolog Forward Chaining) system.
%   This predicate gathers all support triples from the PFC system using the 'pfc_support_relation/1' predicate.
%   If there are any support triples, they are returned in the 'Triples' list.
%   If no triples are found, an empty list is returned.
%
%   @arg Triples A list of support triples collected from the PFC system.
%
%   @example Collect support triples:
%     ?- pfc_collect_supports(Triples).
%     Triples = [triple1, triple2, triple3].
%
pfc_collect_supports(Triples) :-
  % Use bagof/3 to collect all triples that satisfy pfc_support_relation/1.
  bagof(Triple, pfc_support_relation(Triple), Triples),!.  % Cut to ensure deterministic behavior
% If bagof/3 fails (i.e., no triples are found), return an empty list.
pfc_collect_supports([]).

%!  pfc_support_relation(?Triple) is det.
%
%   Defines the relationship between a Prolog Forward Chaining (PFC) predicate, fact, and trigger.
%   This predicate is used to structure support relationships in the PFC system by packaging
%   the predicate 'P', fact 'F', and trigger 'T' into a triple '(P,F,T)'.
%   It relies on the 'pfc_spft/3' predicate to obtain the individual components.
%
%   @arg Triple A tuple '(P, F, T)' where 'P' is the predicate, 'F' is the fact, 
%               and 'T' is the trigger in the PFC system.
%
%   @example Querying for a specific support triple:
%     ?- pfc_support_relation((P, F, T)).
%     P = some_predicate,
%     F = some_fact,
%     T = some_trigger.
%
pfc_support_relation((P, F, T)) :-
  % Use pfc_spft/3 to unify P, F, and T as components of the support triple.
  pfc_spft(P, F, T).

%!  pfc_make_supports(+PSupportTuple) is det.
%
%   Creates support for a fact by adding it to the PFC (Prolog Forward Chaining) support
%   structure. The support tuple consists of a fact 'P' and two support sources 'S1' and 'S2'.
%
%   The predicate first adds the support for the fact using 'pfcAddSupport/2', associating
%   the fact 'P' with the pair '(S1, S2)'. It then attempts to classify the fact 'P' by calling
%   'pfcAddType1/1', though failure to classify does not cause the operation to fail due to the 
%   use of the disjunction with 'true'. A cut ('!') is placed to prevent unnecessary backtracking.
%
%   @arg PSupportTuple A tuple '(P, S1, S2)' where 'P' is the fact to support and 'S1', 'S2' are
%                      the support sources.
%
%   @example
%     % Add support for a fact 'foo' with support sources 'a' and 'b'.
%     ?- pfc_make_supports((foo, a, b)).
%
pfc_make_supports((P,S1,S2)) :-
  % Add the support for fact P, with S1 and S2 as the sources.
  pfcAddSupport(P,(S1,S2)),
  % Try to classify the fact P using pfcAddType1/1, or succeed with true if classification fails.
  (pfcAddType1(P); true),
  % Cut to prevent backtracking after adding support and classification.
  !.


%!  pfcTriggerKey(+Trigger, -Key) is det.
%
%   Extracts the best indexing key from a given Trigger.
%
%   This predicate determines a key for indexing the trigger (first argument).
%   Different types of triggers have different structures, and this predicate
%   attempts to extract the most appropriate key term for efficient indexing.
%
%   @arg Trigger The trigger term, which can take various forms.
%   @arg Key The term used for indexing the trigger.
%
%   @examples
%     ?- pfcTriggerKey('$pt$'(foo, bar), Key).
%     Key = foo.
%
%     ?- pfcTriggerKey('$nt$'(baz, qux, quux), Key).
%     Key = baz.
%
pfcTriggerKey('$pt$'(Key,_), Key).
pfcTriggerKey('$pt$'(Key,_,_), Key).
pfcTriggerKey('$nt$'(Key,_,_), Key).
pfcTriggerKey(Key, Key).

%!  pfc_trigger_key(+Trigger, -Key) is det.
%
%   Retrieves the key from the trigger for use as the first argument
%   of the trigger base clause that stores the trigger.
%
%   This predicate attempts to extract a key from a given trigger. Depending on
%   the form of the trigger, different extraction rules are applied. If the trigger
%   is a variable, it will unify with itself. For more complex structures like 'chart/2',
%   the specific elements inside the structure are extracted as the key.
%
%   @arg Trigger The trigger term, which can have different forms like variables,
%        or structures such as 'chart/2'.
%   @arg Key The term extracted as the key from the trigger.
%
%   @examples
%     ?- pfc_trigger_key(chart(word('apple'), some_list), Key).
%     Key = apple.
%
%     ?- pfc_trigger_key(chart(stem(['a', 'b', 'c']), some_list), Key).
%     Key = 'a'.
%
%     ?- pfc_trigger_key(foo, Key).
%     Key = foo.
%
pfc_trigger_key(X, X) :- var(X), !.
pfc_trigger_key(chart(word(W), _L), W) :- !.
pfc_trigger_key(chart(stem([Char1|_Rest]), _L), Char1) :- !.
pfc_trigger_key(chart(Concept, _L), Concept) :- !.
pfc_trigger_key(X, X).

%!  nb_pushval(+Name, +Value) is det.
%
%   Push a new Value onto the named non-backtrackable variable.
%
%   If a value is already associated with the given Name, the new Value is added 
%   to the front of the list. If no value is currently associated with Name, a new 
%   list containing Value is created and stored under Name.
%
%   @arg Name  The name of the non-backtrackable variable.
%   @arg Value The value to be pushed onto the list stored in the non-backtrackable variable.
%
%   @example
%     % Push values to a non-backtrackable variable 'foo':
%     ?- nb_pushval(foo, 1).
%     ?- nb_pushval(foo, 2).
%     ?- nb_current(foo, X).
%     X = [2, 1].
%
nb_pushval(Name, Value) :-
    % If a value is already associated with Name, add the new Value to the front of the list.
    nb_current(Name, Before) ->
        nb_setval(Name, [Value | Before])
    ;
    % Otherwise, create a new list with the Value.
    nb_setval(Name, [Value]).

%!  nb_peekval(+Name, -Value) is semidet.
%
%   Peek at the top value of the list associated with the non-backtrackable variable.
%
%   This predicate retrieves the first value from the list stored in the non-backtrackable 
%   variable without modifying the list.
%
%   @arg Name  The name of the non-backtrackable variable.
%   @arg Value The value retrieved from the top of the list.
%
%   @example
%     % Peek at the top value in the list for 'foo':
%     ?- nb_pushval(foo, 1), nb_peekval(foo, X).
%     X = 1.
%
nb_peekval(Name, Value) :-
    % Retrieve the first value from the list associated with Name.
    nb_current(Name, [Value | _Before]).

%!  nb_hasval(+Name, +Value) is semidet.
%
%   Check if a Value is present in the list stored in the non-backtrackable variable.
%
%   This predicate succeeds if the specified Value is present in the list associated with 
%   the non-backtrackable variable.
%
%   @arg Name  The name of the non-backtrackable variable.
%   @arg Value The value to check for in the list.
%
%   @example
%     % Check if '1' is in the list associated with 'foo':
%     ?- nb_pushval(foo, 1), nb_hasval(foo, 1).
%     true.
%
nb_hasval(Name, Value) :-
    % Check if Value is present in the list associated with Name.
    nb_current(Name, List),member(Value, List).

%!  nb_popval(+Name, -Value) is semidet.
%
%   Pop the top value from the list stored in the non-backtrackable variable.
%
%   This predicate removes the first value from the list associated with the non-backtrackable 
%   variable and unifies it with Value.
%
%   @arg Name  The name of the non-backtrackable variable.
%   @arg Value The value popped from the top of the list.
%
%   @example
%     % Pop a value from the list associated with 'foo':
%     ?- nb_pushval(foo, 1), nb_pushval(foo, 2), nb_popval(foo, X).
%     X = 2.
%
nb_popval(Name, Value) :-
    % Remove the first value from the list associated with Name and update the list.
    nb_current(Name, [Value | Before]) ->
        nb_setval(Name, Before).

%!  reset_shown_justs is det.
%
%   Resets the tracking of shown justifications in the system.
%   This predicate removes all existing entries from the 't_l:shown_why/1' predicate, 
%   effectively clearing any stored justifications.
%   Additionally, it performs a no-operation call to 'color_line/2' with 
%   red color and line number 1, which may be for diagnostic or logging purposes.
%
%   @example
%   % Reset the shown justifications:
%   ?- reset_shown_justs.
%
reset_shown_justs :-
    % Remove all entries of shown justifications from the system.
    retractall(t_l:shown_why(_)),
    % Call a no-op function to potentially color a line for diagnostic purposes.
    nop(color_line(red, 1)).

%!  clear_proofs is det.
%
%   Clears all stored proof data from the 't_l:whybuffer/2' predicate and optionally
%   logs the action using 'color_line/2'.
%
%   This predicate retracts all facts related to 't_l:whybuffer/2', effectively
%   clearing the stored proofs. After clearing, it may call 'color_line/2' with the
%   arguments 'cyan' and '1' for potential logging or visual feedback.
%
%   @example Clear all stored proofs:
%       ?- clear_proofs.
%       true.
%
clear_proofs :- 
    % Retract all facts from the 't_l:whybuffer/2' predicate, clearing the proof data.
    retractall(t_l:whybuffer(_P, _Js)),
    % Optionally log or provide visual feedback by calling 'color_line/2'.
    nop(color_line(cyan, 1)).

%!  lookup_spft_match(+A, +B, -C) is nondet.
%
%   Matches a specific pattern by ensuring that 'A' is unchanged after a lookup operation.
%
%   This predicate first creates a copy of 'A' (as 'AA') to ensure the original term is preserved.
%   Then, it calls 'lookup_spft/3' with the arguments 'A', 'B', and 'C'. After the lookup, it checks 
%   whether the original term 'A' is still structurally identical to its copy 'AA' using '=@=/2'.
%
%   This can be useful for ensuring that the lookup operation does not modify the input term 'A'.
%
%   @arg A The term to be matched and checked for preservation.
%   @arg B The second argument passed to 'lookup_spft/3', typically used for lookup purposes.
%   @arg C The output variable to hold the result of the lookup operation.
%
%   @example Lookup a match while ensuring that 'A' is unchanged:
%       ?- lookup_spft_match(some_term, some_key, Result).
%       Result = ...
%
lookup_spft_match(A, B, C) :-
    % Create a copy of 'A' as 'AA' to preserve the original term.
    copy_term(A, AA),
    % Perform the lookup using 'lookup_spft/3'.
    lookup_spft(A, B, C),
    % Ensure that 'A' is still structurally identical to 'AA'.
    A =@= AA.

%!  lookup_spft_match_deeper(+H, +Fact, -Trigger) is nondet.
%
%   Performs a deeper lookup operation by ensuring the head term 'H' is unchanged after the lookup.
%
%   This predicate creates a copy of the term 'H' (as 'HH') to ensure the original term is preserved.
%   It then performs a lookup using 'lookup_spft/3' with the pattern '(H :- _B)', where 'H' is matched 
%   with the head of a clause, and the body is ignored. After the lookup, the predicate checks if the 
%   original term 'H' is still structurally identical to its copy 'HH' using '=@=/2'.
%
%   This is particularly useful for cases where the lookup involves clauses, and you want to ensure that 
%   the head of the clause remains unchanged during the operation.
%
%   @arg H The head term to be matched and checked for preservation.
%   @arg Fact The second argument passed to 'lookup_spft/3', typically representing a fact to be looked up.
%   @arg Trigger The output variable to hold the result of the lookup operation.
%
%   @example Lookup a match while ensuring that the head 'H' is unchanged:
%       ?- lookup_spft_match_deeper(head_term, some_fact, Trigger).
%       Trigger = ...
%
lookup_spft_match_deeper(H, Fact, Trigger) :-
    % Create a copy of 'H' as 'HH' to preserve the original term.
    copy_term(H, HH),
    % Perform the lookup using 'lookup_spft/3' with the pattern '(H :- _B)'.
    lookup_spft((H :- _B), Fact, Trigger),
    % Ensure that 'H' is still structurally identical to 'HH'.
    H =@= HH.

%!  lookup_spft_match_first(+A, +B, -C) is nondet.
%
%   Performs a lookup operation, preferring a match where 'A' remains unchanged, but falling back to a regular lookup if needed.
%
%   If 'A' is instantiated (nonvar), the predicate first tries to find a match using 'lookup_spft_match/3', which ensures 'A' is preserved.
%   If this fails, it falls back to a standard lookup with 'lookup_spft/3'. 
%   The 'no_repeats/1' predicate is used to ensure that duplicate results are removed.
%
%   If 'A' is uninstantiated (var), the predicate directly performs a standard lookup using 'lookup_spft/3'.
%
%   @arg A The term to be matched. If instantiated, it will first attempt to ensure that 'A' is unchanged.
%   @arg B The second argument passed to 'lookup_spft/3', typically used for lookup purposes.
%   @arg C The output variable to hold the result of the lookup operation.
%
%   @example Perform a lookup, preferring a match that preserves 'A':
%       ?- lookup_spft_match_first(some_term, some_key, Result).
%       Result = ...
%
%   @example Perform a fallback lookup if no match-preserving result is found:
%       ?- lookup_spft_match_first(var_term, some_key, Result).
%       Result = ...
%
lookup_spft_match_first(A, B, C) :-
    % If 'A' is instantiated (nonvar), prioritize finding a match where 'A' remains unchanged.
    nonvar(A), !,
    % Use 'no_repeats/1' to ensure duplicate results are avoided. Try 'lookup_spft_match/3' first,
    % and if it fails, fall back to 'lookup_spft/3'.
    no_repeats(((lookup_spft_match(A, B, C); lookup_spft(A, B, C)))).
% If 'A' is not instantiated, simply perform a lookup using 'lookup_spft/3'.
lookup_spft_match_first(A, B, C) :-
    lookup_spft(A, B, C).

%!  pfc_is_info(:TermC) is semidet.
%
%   Determines if a term is classified as PFC information.
%
%   This predicate checks various patterns to determine whether the given term should be
%   considered as PFC (Prolog Forward Chaining) information. It handles specific forms 
%   such as pairs, facts with certain functors, and specific patterns. The predicate
%   succeeds if the term matches one of these patterns, indicating that it is PFC information.
%
%   @arg TermC The term to be checked. It can be a pair of a control word ('CWC') and some information,
%        or it may follow other specific structures defined below.
%
%   @example Check if a term is PFC information:
%       ?- pfc_is_info((atom_info, some_info)).
%       true.
%
%       ?- pfc_is_info(pfc_bc_only(some_fact)).
%       true.
%
pfc_is_info((CWC, Info)) :-
    % If 'CWC' is an atom and recognized as PFC info, or recurse on the second part ('Info').
    (atom(CWC), is_a_info(CWC)) ; 
    pfc_is_info(Info).
pfc_is_info(pfc_bc_only(C)) :-
    % Check if 'C' is a non-variable term.
    is_ftNonvar(C), !.
pfc_is_info(infoF(C)) :-
    % Check if 'C' is a non-variable term in the 'infoF/1' structure.
    is_ftNonvar(C), !.
pfc_is_info(inherit_above(_, _)).
    % The pattern 'inherit_above/2' is always considered PFC information.

%!  is_a_info(+CWC) is semidet.
%
%   Determines if the given control word ('CWC') is classified as PFC information.
%
%   This predicate checks if the given control word ('CWC') is either explicitly identified as "fail" 
%   or if it follows the 'is_pfc_chained/1' rule. The predicate succeeds if either of these conditions

%   - If the clause is already asserted, it succeeds and returns the reference to that clause.
%   - Otherwise, it checks for clause matching using 'clause/3' and compares the head with '=@=/2'.
